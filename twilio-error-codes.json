For more details, including potential workarounds, please see our help center article [\"How Does Carrier Filtering Work?\"](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223181848-How-Does-Carrier-Filtering-Work)\r\n\r\n#### Continued issues with error 30004\r\nTwilio's support team can help investigate what went wrong with delivering your message. Please collect 3 or more message SIDs in your [SMS logs](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/logs) from the last 24 hours that were flagged with Error 30004, and [open a support request](https://www.twilio.com/console/support/tickets/create).", "code": 30004, "log_level": "ERROR", "last_updated": "2018-09-06T15:00:21.000+0000", "message": "Message blocked", "secondary_message": "The destination number you are trying to reach is blocked from receiving this message (e.g. due to blacklisting).", "product": "Programmable SMS"}, {"date_created": "2016-03-31T17:14:34.000+0000", "const_partition": "1", "docs": "## Error - 30003\r\n\r\n## Message Delivery - Unreachable destination handset\r\n\r\n### Possible Causes \r\n*  The destination handset you are trying to reach is switched off or otherwise unavailable.\r\n*  The device you are trying to reach does not have sufficient signal\r\n*  The device cannot receive SMS (for example, the phone number belongs to a landline)\r\n*  There is an issue with the mobile carrier\r\n\r\n### Possible Solutions\r\nThe first step to troubleshooting this issue is to attempt to replicate the problems. Attempt to send another test message to this user via a REST API request, or through the API Explorer in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/runtime/api-explorer/voice). \r\n\r\nIf you see similar results, continue troubleshooting with the following checklist:\r\n*  Is the destination device powered on?\r\n*  Does the device have sufficient signal?

By enabling this feature, CoPilot will attempt first to send your message out using your short code, and then make a second attempt over a [long code](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-long-code-phone-number) if necessary. For more details, please see our blog post [\"Improve SMS Deliverability with Fallback to Long Code\"](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/06/improve-sms-deliverability-with-fallback-to-long-code.html).\r\n\r\n**Sprint** customers may be able to whitelist messages sent from your short code by texting the phrase `Allow XXXXX` to **9999**, replacing `XXXXX` with your short code. However, customers from other wireless carriers will likely need to reach out to their carrier's support group to enable \"Premium\" or short code messaging.\r\n\r\n#### Messages sent from long codes\r\nRepeated Error 30003 results on undelivered messages sent from long codes (regular phone numbers) could be due to carrier filtering. \r\n\r\nThe rules for carrier filtering vary throughout the industry, making it difficult at times to pin down exactly why a message is being filtered out.
